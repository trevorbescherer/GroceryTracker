Summary of the Project

The Grocery Tracker project is a C++ program designed to read grocery purchase data from a text file, count the frequency of each item, and provide a detailed summary of the results. The program displays how many times each item appears in the file, creates a histogram visualization of item frequencies, and writes the results to a backup file (frequency.dat). The main goal of this project was to practice file input/output operations, data management using the C++ Standard Template Library (STL), and basic algorithmic logic for counting and organizing information efficiently.

What I Did Particularly Well

I implemented an organized and modular structure that made the program easy to follow. I used a std::map container to store item-frequency pairs, which allowed for efficient lookups and automatic sorting of the data. I also emphasized clarity by including descriptive comments and meaningful variable names. The output formatting was another strong point—I ensured that the results were presented neatly and readably, which improved the user experience.

Areas for Enhancement

In future iterations, I could improve the program by adding better input validation and error handling. For example, the program could check whether the input file exists before attempting to read it or handle cases where the data is empty or malformed. Additionally, implementing a more user-friendly interface—such as allowing the user to search for specific items interactively—would make the program more dynamic. These improvements would enhance the program’s usability, efficiency, and resilience.

Challenges and How I Overcame Them

One of the biggest challenges was managing file input/output while ensuring the data was accurately read and stored. At first, I had issues with handling end-of-file conditions and correctly parsing input lines with varying spacing. I resolved these issues by experimenting with different input methods (getline and the stream extraction operator) and reviewing C++ documentation on file stream behavior. Testing the program with multiple text files also helped confirm that my logic was stable and adaptable to different data sets.

Transferable Skills

This project helped me strengthen several valuable and transferable skills:

File handling and persistent data storage — reading, writing, and updating text-based data files.

Use of STL containers — particularly maps for associative data storage and iteration.

Algorithmic thinking — efficiently counting and organizing large amounts of input data.

Code readability and documentation — writing clean, maintainable code that could easily be updated or reused in other projects.

These skills will directly transfer to more advanced software engineering and data-processing projects across multiple programming languages.

Maintaining Readability, Maintainability, and Adaptability

I kept the program readable by using clear, consistent indentation and by dividing functionality into separate, well-defined functions within the GroceryTracker class. Each function had a single responsibility, such as reading data, counting occurrences, or writing output. This approach made the code more modular and easier to maintain. I also used comments to describe the purpose of each function and logic block, ensuring that anyone reviewing the program could quickly understand its flow. The overall design supports adaptability—new features such as user input menus or sorting options could be added without rewriting existing logic.
